# Ashrail-Archive-Game
 Ashrail Archive is a console-based, text-adventure set in a post‑apocalyptic world where salvaged knowledge is survival. Play as a lone courier who follows clues, converses with eccentric survivors, and cracks a three‑word key to gain access to The Archive — a repository of records that can restart communities.
